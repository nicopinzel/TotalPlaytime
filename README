!!! THE FOLDER WHICH NEEDS TO GO INSIDE YOUR 'ADDON' FOLDER IS INSIDE THE "...-main" FOLDER !!!

The goal of this WoW AddOn is,
to show you with just one command how much time youÂ´ve spent in-game
and it lists the playtime of all of your characters and
also a total summary in the chatframe.

Compatible with all versions until 18-Sep-2024.
Most likely also ever other update will be supported, even if i don't update the version numbers immediately

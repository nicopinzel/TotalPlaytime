!!! INSTALL PATH: X:\...\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns  !!!

The goal of this WoW AddOn is,
to show you with just one command how much time youÂ´ve spent in-game
and it lists the playtime of all of your characters and
also a total summary in the chatframe.

Compatible with all versions until 19-November-2024.
Most likely also every other update will be supported, even if i don't update the version numbers immediately.

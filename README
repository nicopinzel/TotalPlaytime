The goal of this WoW AddOn is,
to show you with just one command how much time you´ve spent in-game
and it lists the playtime of all of your characters and
also a total summary in the chatframe.

I´ll test some more versions and I´ll let you know afterwards which versions are supported.
Until now i can say that the versions of [RETAIL] {7.0.3 to 9.0.5} and also [CLASSIC] {1.13} to {} are fully supported.

- 3.3.5a is also working 99% but sometimes the command isn´t working but i cannot clarify why
  it stops working under certain circumstances.

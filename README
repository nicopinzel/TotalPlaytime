!!! INSTALL PATH: X:\...\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns  !!!

The goal of this WoW AddOn is,
to show you with just one command how much time you´ve spent in-game
and it lists the playtime of all of your characters and
also a total summary in the chatframe.

NOW WITH THE POSIBILLITY TO RESET SAID LIST! 
New commands are "/playtime clear" and "/spielzeit löschen" 
This empties the current list and sets a new "zero seconds" timestamp

Compatible with all versions until 05-December-2024.
Most likely also every other update will be supported, even if i don't update the version numbers immediately.
